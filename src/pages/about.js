            <div className='textContainer'>
                <p>I’m a software engineer based in Portland, Oregon. I love writing clean code, solving twisty puzzles, and exploring new technologies. At the moment, I’m building legal hold solutions with my team at Zapproved and figuring out TypeScript in my free time.</p>
                <p>I was always “the one in the house who knows what to do when the computer stops working,” but I took my first serious crack at coding from scratch in 2017, when a friend put a beginner’s Python book in my hands. I then attended Alchemy Code Lab’s Boot Camp I & II to build a foundation of knowledge and good habits, and then I was off to the races building a variety of useful (or at least useful to my weird brain) web-based applications, first for myself and then for the good folks at Precoa. </p>
                <p>When I’m not busy building amazing things, you’ll find me finishing a book (and adding four more to my to-read list), running, playing guitar, or baking something complicated. On the weekends my wife and I are either exploring some new corner of the Pacific Northwest or discovering our new favorite restaurant or record store in town.</p>
