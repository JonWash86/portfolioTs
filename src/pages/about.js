            <div className='textContainer'>
                <p>Originally from Arizona, I migrated through California to snag a film degree before settling in Portland almost fifteen years ago. A liberal arts degree led to customer service and admin work; it was fun and rewarding, but at a certain point I wanted a career that allowed me to get ahead of problems and solve puzzles.</p>
                <p>Since 2018, I've been putting my skills to work building a variety of web-based applications for my own use, as well as building, improving and maintaining software as an engineer, first with Precoa and now with Zapproved. While I love that the sheer variety of languages and frameworks means there's always something new to explore, I'm especially comfortable working with Angular, React, and PHP.</p>
                <p>In my free time, you'll find me reading, baking, running, playing guitar, or buying records. My wife and I try to get out and explore at least once a month (I highly recommend checking out eastern Oregon). I'll be more than glad to share pictures of my dog as well as my three cats, whom I'm very proud did not run across the keyboard once while I wrote up this whole thing.</p>
